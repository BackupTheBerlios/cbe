3ds2cbs README

3ds2cbs is a utility converting 3D studio model files into a more efficient
proprietary file format called csp. It basically takes a 3ds file, computes
smoothed normals for the meshes, and decomposites all the meshes into
triangle strips.  All data from the 3ds file except for the mesh and the
needed texture data is ignored.

This utility is distributed with CBE, the Change Blindness
Experiment/Environment developed at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich.
