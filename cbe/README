CBE is the free and open Change Blindness Experiment/Environment developed
at the Ludwig-Maximilian-Universität Muenchen. It was started during a
project-seminar dealing with perception and especially Change Blindness.
The idea is to provide a frame work that can be used to simulate real world
situations in which people are usually blind to the visual changes around
them.

This project is a joint effort between students and staff from the Technical
University of Munich and the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich. To take
full advantage of CBE's program features you need an eye movement tracker
and ideally access to a professional Psychology lab.

CBE is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. For more
information, see the COPYING document provided with the CBE program.

Program installation and configuration is explained in detail in the INSTALL
file. It is recommended you read that document, and if it's just to find out
how to set up CBE properly. The latest program sources and news are always
