CBE INSTALL
-=-=-=-=-=-

0. REQUIREMENTS

To run CBE it's best to have a UNIX (-like) operating system, but it
also compiles fine with Windows 9x/NT/2000 if additional libraries and tools
are installed (e.g. Cygwin, MinGW or DJGPP).

Compiling CBE from scratch requires you to have the following packages on your
system:

- Mesa library 3.3 (or higher)

- GNU C++ compiler 2.95 (or higher)

- GNU autoconf

- GNU automake


1. CONFIGURE

If you have downloaded and installed a binary distribution of CBE, then there
is no need to read the following instructions. Continue with section 3 and 4
instead.

If you have downloaded a compressed source code archive, then please proceed
the following steps. Change to the CBE distribution directory (where the
INSTALL file can be found) and run

      ./configure

For a list of available options for configuration, call configure with the
--help parameter. Running configure creates a Makefile in your source code
directory. If you like, have a look at it before you continue, though this
should not be necessary, unless you want to have debugging information
included or things like that.


2. INSTALL

After configure has successfully guessed your system's specific values, you
can compile the CBE source code with

      make

If you have not changed any of the predefined values for configure then CBE
will be installed in /usr/local/bin. Become 'root' now and run

      make install


3. SET-UP CBE

4. RUN CBE

Now try it out! CBE can be started with

      cbe

on the command line.
